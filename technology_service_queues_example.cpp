/*
 * Analysis Answers
 *
 * B4 — Circular queue state
 * After LT-101 and LT-102 are checked out, why can LT-105 use an array position
 * near the beginning even though LT-103 and LT-104 are still available? Explain
 * the roles of frontIndex, rearIndex, and itemCount.
 * Answer:
 *frontIndex is the index of the next device to check out, rearIndex is the index of the most recently returned device.
 itemCount keeps track of how many devices are currently in the queue. When LT-101 and LT-102 are checked out, frontIndex advances.
 * B5 — Dynamic queue empty state
 * After SR-231 is handled, why must rear become nullptr as well as front? Explain
 * what would be wrong if rear still pointed to the deleted node before SR-245 arrives.
 * Answer: If rear still pointed to the deleted node, it would lead to undefined behavior when trying to enqueue a new request.
 *Rear must be set to nullptr to indicate that the queue is empty and ready to accept new requests.
